## Description 
-  In this assignment I built a database and program that interacts with that database. After creating the database, I seeded it with default datum. When running the program the user is met with choices of view employees, roles, and departments; and is also given the choice of add employees roles or departments. The user is then prompted with more questions and input fields that take in the users input and adds to the database accordingly.
